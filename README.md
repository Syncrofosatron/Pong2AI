# Pong2AI

I did this while I was new at game development. The first engine I learned was Love2D and Lua, the scripting language.
So, this project utilizes the same.

The game skeleton is built by the instructor, our job is to implement some feature so below are the features I implemented. 
The 2nd one was not necessary but I wanted to implement that :)

1. Built an AI system to detect the movement of ball so as to compete with player with varying difficulty.
2. Implemented music playing loop feature.
